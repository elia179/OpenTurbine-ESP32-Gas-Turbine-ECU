## Do I need programming experience? Do I download the source ZIP?

No. Download `OpenTurbineSetupTool.exe` from the official release. Do not use GitHub’s **Download ZIP** source-code button for normal Windows setup.

## Which boards are supported?

Use a Classic ESP32 with at least 4 MB flash, or an ESP32-S3 DevKitC-1-compatible board with at least 8 MB flash. The same universal S3 image runs on 8 MB and 16 MB modules and does not require PSRAM. ESP32-C3 and other unlisted ESP32 families are not supported by the current normal setup path.

## Does driver installation require a restart?

Usually not. The Setup Tool rescans after installing a driver and shows when Windows specifically requires a restart. If the connected CP210x/WCH bridge has no COM port, it offers the matching driver even when an unrelated COM port exists.

## What does Clean install erase? How does Update keep my setup?

Clean install/reinstall erases the selected board. **Update and keep my setup** is the normal Wi-Fi update path for a working controller; it backs up the engine file first. Keep backups private because they can contain Wi-Fi credentials.

## Can I reuse a pre-2.0 engine file?

OpenTurbine 2.0 intentionally replaces older hardware and startup-safety
behavior. Keep the old file as a reference, but use a clean installation and
rebuild/review Hardware, Controllers, System, Calibration, Sequence, and every dry
shutdown test. Read the
[v2 migration guide](https://github.com/elia179/OpenTurbine-ESP32-Gas-Turbine-ECU/blob/main/docs/V2_MIGRATION.md)
before moving an engine installation.

## Can I explore without a turbine? Can GPIO power a pump or igniter?

You can explore and configure the dashboard with loads physically disconnected. GPIO pins are 3.3 V logic only: they do not power pumps, valves, starters, or ignition. Use suitable protected driver electronics.

## Can I add a sensor or output that is not one of the built-in names?

Yes. In **Hardware**, add a generic input or output with a readable name, the correct signal type, connection, range and safe states. Use that displayed device name when selecting it in Controllers, Sequence or Tools. Its electrical interface still needs suitable conditioning or a rated driver.

## What can simple controls do?

Simple controls live with the other output owners on **Controllers**. A control can switch an output at a sensor threshold with hysteresis or map an input range directly to a variable PWM/servo output range. Each output has one normal owner; Sequence owns ordered startup/shutdown actions and safety can always override normal demand.

## Why does Windows warn about the Setup Tool?

Use the official OpenTurbine download link and choose **More info → Run anyway** when Windows offers it. Do not disable Windows security or use an installer from another website. Normal installation does not require understanding checksums; the Setup Tool automatically verifies the firmware package it downloads.

## Where are logs and complete instructions?

Setup Tool diagnostics are under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenTurbine\SetupTool\logs`. The [User Guide and reference]({{ '/user-guide/' | relative_url }}) covers operating and wiring details. Use [Setup Help](https://github.com/elia179/OpenTurbine-ESP32-Gas-Turbine-ECU/issues/new?template=setup_help.yml) for installation problems.

## Is OpenTurbine certified or inherently safe? Does it work on macOS/Linux?

No. It is experimental and requires independently verified limits, drivers, and physical shutdown protection. There is no graphical macOS/Linux installer; manual PlatformIO builds are an advanced/developer path.
