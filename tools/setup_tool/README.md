# OpenTurbine Setup Tool

Windows setup/update helper for OpenTurbine boards.

The home screen separates **Clean install / reinstall** (USB, erases the entire
selected board) from **Update and keep my setup** (Wi-Fi, backs up and retains
the existing engine setup). Do not weaken this distinction in release builds.

The tool does not redistribute or silently install serial drivers. If Windows
cannot see a board, the GUI identifies the likely USB bridge and opens the
official Silicon Labs or WCH download page for the user.

Build from this directory:

```powershell
python -X utf8 generate_icon.py
go test ./...
go run github.com/akavel/rsrc@v0.10.2 -ico OpenTurbineSetupTool.ico -manifest OpenTurbineSetupTool.manifest -o rsrc_windows_amd64.syso
go build -ldflags="-H windowsgui -s -w" -o OpenTurbineSetupTool.exe .
```

`rsrc_windows_amd64.syso` embeds the tracked `.ico` and manifest. Regenerate it
after changing either source file; CI also regenerates it before release builds.

For public releases, sign `OpenTurbineSetupTool.exe` before hashing or
publishing it. See `docs/SETUP_TOOL.md` for the Authenticode signing workflow
and GitHub Actions secrets.

The app downloads `OpenTurbine_Recommended.zip` from the latest GitHub release,
or uses a checksum-verified cached copy. A local
`OpenTurbine_Recommended.zip` placed next to the EXE remains the explicit
offline override. If a Classic ESP32 is not detected, unplug it, hold BOOT
while plugging it back in, and keep BOOT held through the retry until writing
starts.

Build the recommended ZIP from the repository root:

```powershell
python tools/build_setup_package.py `
  --esptool "$env:USERPROFILE\.platformio\penv\Scripts\esptool.exe"
```

The generated manifest includes `package_schema: 4`; the EXE and ZIP must come
from the same release family. The ZIP also includes OpenTurbine's license and
the bundled esptool third-party notice.

Release assets:

```text

OpenTurbineSetupTool.exe.sha256
OpenTurbine_Recommended.zip
OpenTurbine_Recommended.zip.sha256
